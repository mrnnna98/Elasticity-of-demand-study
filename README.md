# Elasticity-of-demand-study
This study was carried out at Chalmers University of Technology with the porpuse of designing a microgrid which size would assure the maximum profit for the company which would invest in it. The study was therefore carried out considering a first load demand (generated with RAMP https://github.com/RAMP-project/RAMP) with the real data on the energy consumption needs of the local population, then it was considered an increase in electricity price and applied a certain elasticity for electrical demand, the load curve was generated again. After the new generation of the demand the microgrid was sized with a microgrid optimization tool: MicroGridsPy (https://github.com/SESAM-Polimi/MicroGridsPy-SESAM). The process was automatically iterated many times in order to find out if a certain sizing of the microgrid would assure a maximum profit.
